Complete rewrite of FunFX.

  * The FunFX API is statically generated code instead of dynamically generated
  * Big poster with class diagram
  * Hash based lookup of elements
  * Flex stacktrace is included in Ruby stack trace
  * Elements can be looked up by a "path" of ids: several hashes
  * Types are coerced back to correct Ruby types when asking for properties
  * Full demo app included in the source tree
  * Moved to Git
  * Automated build using Rake
  * Proper packaging as a Ruby gem (NEEDS WORK TO INCLUDE THE FUNFX.SWC)
  * Automated testing using RSpec
  * The code is largely based on Adobe's AutoQuick example
